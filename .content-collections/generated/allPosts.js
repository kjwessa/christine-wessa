    "content": "A few years ago I was earning my “saint points” by getting up before the sun to go to mass and then heading out to the abortion clinic to pray. Mass was insanely early, like 5:45 am, and I just thought someone should've canonized me right then and there for spending my free day getting up before the sun to go to mass! Well, I felt dern right proud of myself for making such a “big” sacrifice and saving babies at the same time. I sat during the mass just beaming from the inside out thinking of how wonderful I was. Then he said it. The priest began his homily with, “God does not need you.”\n\nDid I just hear Father correctly? He must've seen the color drain right out of my face because he looked at me again and said “God does not need you.” All of a sudden I experienced so many emotions at one time. I felt angered that he would say such a thing when I had gotten up so early just to do this. I felt saddened after the reality of his words sank in and I realized that it was indeed correct that God did not need me. He is God. He can do it all. I felt my whole purpose for existing was completely shattered in one simple sentence. But then Father said, “He does not need you, but He WANTS you.” As soon as he said the word “wants,” I felt myself blush. Why was I blushing when just a few seconds before I was ready to high tail it out of mass?\n\nAs I sat in my chair trying to figure out why all of a sudden I felt nervous and giddy, it hit me...I was someone the Lord desired. No, He does not need me. He wants me. Need is out of necessity. Want is out of a desire. God Himself desired all of me. With this new found revelation, I was back in business and ready to conintue with mass and prayer at the abortion clinic. But it wasn't the same Christine who had walked in on her high and mighty horse. I was now the Christine who wanted to please the One who had been desiring me.\n\nLadies, isn't it so true that we are way more eager to do something for a man when we know they have interest in us? Yes! All of a sudden I wanted to be up early and pray at the abortion clinic because God desired me. He was interested in me. He IS interested in me.\n\nI don't always leap up from my bed in the morning as soon as my alarm goes off just because I know God wants me...In fact, that rarely happens. Many times I forget that Someone is pursuing me. Someone is interested in me. Someone desires me. Someone wants me. But when I am reminded again (on a daily basis!) the purpose returns and once again the most simple of tasks, like washing a dish for the umptheenth time, becomes a little gift I can give to that Someone my heart loves.\n\nThis same Someone wants you. Everything about you. He created you to His own liking so it's foolproof, He can't not desire you. If we start living with the confidence that we are wanted, just imagine how much our daily lives will change. Even the most simple of tasks can be transformed into something beautiful.\n\nThe Lord doesn't need you. He wants you.",

    "content": "This week in our Makeup-less Monday video we talked about the question—can we really live in this world but not of it?\n\nYes we can! The answer is quite simple.\n\n**_Live Jesus._**\n\nNo matter what you are doing. **_Live Jesus._** Ask how someone's day is going. Be kind. Be respectful. That stranger is also someone who Jesus loves so much He chose to die for them.\n\nIf you are going to a party—**_live Jesus._** If you are checking out at the grocery store—**_live Jesus_**. If you are going out downtown with your friends—**_live Jesus_**. If you are working out— **_live Jesus_.** If you are going to the movies—**_live Jesus._** If you are playing music for a show—**_live Jesus._**\n\nSo…back to my Subway guy…\n\nOne year for my New Year’s resolution I really wanted to do something that would actually stick with me and be meaningful (I normally don’t make new year resolutions anyways. I’m just that type of person haha). So, out of nowhere I heard a still small voice say “Love everyone you meet.” Naturally I was confused about how to do that since I did not know every single person. Then it became clear. If I stepped outside of myself and sought the good of the other person then I could love anyone! Well…here goes.\n\nI had been trying this for a few weeks now and it was intimidating. Being on the more introverted and shy side it was hard for me to initiate conversation but it was good. Stretching.\n\nA few years ago I was on a trip as a chaperon and we stopped off at Subway to grab a sandwich. As I was approaching the man who would take my order he asked “what do you want?” My heart started pounding because I knew I needed to follow through with my new year’s resolution (it had only been two weeks since New Years for heaven's sake). This poor guy didn’t even look up because he was so busy taking orders and was just going about his business. I quietly said, “how are you doing today?” The man immediately looked up at me with a blank stare. Startled. Then tears began to well up in his eyes. I wasn’t sure what he was about to do or say next and I thought to myself “what have I done?!\". He stared at me for probably 3 seconds total but it felt like 3 minutes. He finally spoke and said “I have worked here for so many years and I can’t tell you when the last time was that someone asked how my day was going. People come in every day and tell me what they want on their sandwich and then go about their day.”\n\n_He was caught off guard because a stranger took a moment to actually see him._\n\nHe smiled and got the rest of my order. As I was checking out he grabbed a chocolate chip cookie and put it in my sandwich bag and said “this is on me!” (If you know me then you know that I have a love for chocolate. Sweets in general. I don’t have a sweet tooth. I have sweet teeth. So this chocolate chip cookie was quite the treat!)\n\nIn all seriousness...\n\nI was deeply touched by this man’s reaction. He reminded me of how simple it really is to live like Christ in this world. We probably won’t ever perform miracles. We will probably never change water into wine or multiply food but we can and should love each person we meet—and that is when little miracles can happen. When we allow Jesus to work through us He can move hearts. He can perform miracles.\n\nWe **CAN** live in this world but not of it. It can be difficult because we have to choose it every single day. Sometimes we do and sometimes we don't. But we **CAN** do it.\n\nSt. Francis de Sales proclaims it the most simple way, **_“Live Jesus.”_**",

    "content": "Ladies…I am sure you have feared these things before:\n\nFear #1: Am I too much?\n\nIs my personality too loud? Can he handle all my sass? Do I have too much baggage? Do I talk too much? Am I too emotional?\n\nFear #2: Am I enough?\n\nDo I have enough personality to keep them interested? Am I too simple? Am I funny enough? Am I smart enough? Am I pretty enough?\n\nWhy do we ask ourselves these questions? Especially as ladies, these are questions that continue to seep into our thoughts (all the time). But why?\n\n_Because of Love._\n\nWe were made from Love, by Love, to love. That is why we fear being too much or not enough—we long to know if we ARE enough to be loved.\n\nAnd guess what…we won’t be enough for this world (in the sense that we will not love perfectly and we will not find perfect love in each other). But here is the good part—we were not made for this world! As St. Augustine said “my heart is restless until it rests in You.” We will never be fulfilled in this life because we were not made for this life.\n\nAll of our restlessness has a purpose. It reminds us that we are made for more than what this world offers.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong, we can love well and well at that! I have seen many wives and husbands love each other so well and uniquely to each other. I have had my family and friends love me really well. They have thrown surprise parties, bought me chocolate (I’m a sucker for that), prayed with me, made me laugh, encouraged me, fixed my car, defended me from a sketchy guy (yikes), brought me flowers... The list can go on and on and on. Yet I still yearn to know if I am enough to be loved. Why when people have loved me so well?\n\n_Because God is the only one who can fulfill me._\n\nHave you ever thought of the fact that God made you enough for Him? He thought of every single part of you and what you would be like and created you because He loved you so much He couldn’t help Himself that He had to breathe life into you.\n\nYou are enough simply because God created you.  Enough for Him. So don’t worry about being “perfect” for someone. We won’t ever be perfect here on this earth and we should not expect others to be perfect for us.\n\nOne more thing--if you ever hear yourself use the word “fear” for anything please remember this…_fear is NOT from God_.\n\nLadies, this fear of being *too much* or *not enough*… drop it like it’s hot!\n\nBelieve that you are enough because of the mere fact that you are here. You are enough for God and will never be too much for Him. God is where we find perfect love. So take the pressure of yourself to be “perfect” or to love perfectly.  We should try our derndest but also know that we won’t reach perfection here.\n\n_Give yourself a break and rest in the fact that you are enough to be loved._\n\nBe His,",

I saw that it was beautiful and good because it was what God wanted me to do at that time.\n\nWe all desire happiness—that is good! We all want it and it is easy to find things that make us happy here on earth such as: family, friends, chocolate, a good joke, game night, working a job we enjoy, our favorite sports team winning a game (let’s go IRISH!), a bowl of ice cream, getting good grades, the list could go on and on.

The Church is made up of many people and many people say they don’t find Jesus there. Want to know why? Look in the mirror. We are not doing a good job of imitating Jesus.” Ouch. That was tough to hear, but it was truth.\n\nIf we want to see change—then we need to be change. If we want to see kindness—then we need to be kind. If we want to see peace—then we need to be peace. If we want to see love—then we need to be love.\n\nWe must start with ourselves, within our own homes. *This is where it begins.*\n\nWe all have the choice to make. You can choose love or not. I am not saying it is easy; I struggle with it every day but I do know that nothing brings more freedom than choosing to love. When you chose to love you free yourself from grudges, you free yourself from hate. And don’t worry, you won’t have to go looking for an opportunity to chose love—it will be there every single day :)\n\nCan you imagine if we all started to act out of love what would happen? The media would have no choice but to show the good news because that was all they could find :)\n\nDeus Caritas Est. God is love. Let's remind the world.\n\nNo matter what—love anyway.\n\n\"People are often unreasonable, illogical and self centered;Forgive them anyway.If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives;Be kind anyway.If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies;Succeed anyway.If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you;Be honest and frank anyway.What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight;Build anyway.If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous;Be happy anyway.The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow;Do good anyway.Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough;Give the world the best you've got anyway.You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and God;It was never between you and them anyway.” -poem engraved on a wall of St. Mother Teresa’s home for children in Calcutta\n\nBe His,",

    "content": "I hope you all enjoyed our Masculine Monday from Ben Bellet: *A Guy's Perspective on Dating*! It's always helpful and inspiring to hear about both sides of the spectrum because we need both sides!\n\nThis got us thinking about dating from a girl's perspective and we came up with 7 practical tips that have helped us when it comes to dating:\n\n1. Be Open\n\nMany times we have our \"picture perfect\" image of who we want our boyfriend or future husband to be. This is not necessarily a good thing. We can become too concerned about what *we* want and close the doors to what *God* wants for us. It is good to have standards and it is actually just fine to find yourself being attracted to a specific type of man, but do not let that hinder you from giving other men a chance. When we open the doorway for God to move He will lead us to what is best for us... And we just might be surprised!\n\n2. Don't Over-spiritualize\n\nUnfortunately, this is something easy to do. I have been guilty of this too! When we desire to do The Lord's will it can be easy to overlook normalcy for \"signs\" from God. When we are actively searching for signs from God we are not giving each other freedom to discern; we are not giving the Lord freedom to speak. Pray and take one day at a time.\n\n3. Be Confident\n\nYou are worth pursuing. You have actually been pursued your entire life already but might not be aware of it! Once you realize you are loved and are worth dying for you begin to live your life with purpose and confidence. You no longer place your value and worth upon whether or not you get asked out on a date. You are already worth it. So be confident that you are loveable and you are worth the pursuit because it is already happening. Confidence in your dignity is attractive!\n\n4. Respect Your Date\n\nWhether or not you are interested in more dates with a man, treat him with respect. He has taken the courage to ask you out! Also, he is worthy of respect regardless of his intentions. Let him know you appreciate his time and intention.\n\n5. Respect Yourself\n\nYou are worth respecting! Respect yourself and do not be afraid to have boundaries. You are worth the wait and so is he. Do not be afraid to lose a guy because you desire and strive for a chaste relationship. If he does not respect that, then take that as a \"sign\" and move on! Know that you deserve to be treated as a lady, as the gift that you are.\n\n6. Love God First\n\nFind your heart's desire in God first. We were made for Him! When we find our belonging in Him, then we can freely love a man without expectation of perfection, because we have found that in God. God is the only One who can love us perfectly, so please do not put that pressure on a man to love you perfectly or to \"complete\" you. God does that.\n\n7. Trust in God\n\nYou can trust Him with your happiness. This can be a daily battle of letting go of our own plans and letting God make our plans for us but it is worth every little battle. He created you and knows you better than you know yourself, so trust that He wants your utmost happiness. If it does not work out with a guy you are interested in, if you are not being asked out on dates, if you are single and waiting... Trust God. Trust that God has your best interest. He will never let you down!\n\nBe His,",

    "content": "\"He has such a good heart but I am just not attracted to him.\"\n\nYou may have heard yourself say this or heard your friend say this once before. Or guys, maybe you have said this too. It happens. And it's actually ok.\n\nThere is a thing called \"attraction\" that was created by God. Sometimes we overlook the fact that attraction is natural AND it is good.\n\nBut...\n\nWith attraction comes a responsibility to love that person outside of the attraction. It is easy to get swept up and romanticize relationships, I have done this many a time. How many times I have I thought, \"Maybe if I just go for a walk in a field at the break of dawn amidst the foggy morning (and to my suprise but not really) I run into my future Mr. Darcy coming to profess his love for me!\" Anyone else fall to pieces during this scene in Pride and Prejudice? But still, I am only thinking of myself and my want to be loved and desired. I am not necessarily thinking of the other person.\n\nAs we talked about in our Makeupless-Monday video (link to video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r0i_p45AMo), \"How Far is too Far?\" is a question so many people want to know. When we are attracted to someone the physical affection comes naturally. Like we said in the video, this is GOOD.\n\nBut...\n\nIf we are asking the question \"How Far is Too Far?\" then we are actually asking the wrong question. When I was in highschool, a teacher of mine once said that if we are asking this question then it is like the person asking is pushing the other closer and closer to the edge of a cliff to see how close to the edge they can get the other without pushing them over. Why would we want to do this to someone we love? Actually, why would we want to do that to anyone?\n\nWe should want the good for every relationship we have because honestly, if we are dating someone either they are our spouse or someone else's (unless they decide on another vocation).  We need to stop seeing chastity as a list of rules and regulations but more as a desire for that person's good.\n\n\"Purity is not about following a list of rules so that you'll avoid hell. It's about wanting Heaven for the person you love.\"-Jason Evert\n\nPracticing chastity is difficult. Sometimes we fall, but the important thing is to get back up and know that you are worth protecting, you are worth the sacrifice and so is the other.\n\nDon't ever forget that no matter how far you've gone it's never too late to come back and no matter how much you've fallen and or continue to struggle, your identify as a gift will never be taken from you, man or woman.\n\nYou are meant for Heaven.\n\nBe His,",

She is patient with me and quick to forgive. She has strength in her calm demeanor which always gives me peace. Her loving devotion to our baby is most attractive. In her devotion I see her love and strength and motherly beauty.\"\n\n\"Phyically, I loved her hair. That was the initial physical attraction. Her love for God and the Eucharist made me realize how undeserving I was to love her and lead her. Her subordination and willingness to allow me to lead our spiritual relationship gave me confidence. When a man is confident in his lady's love, just like Christ's love, that is the greatest feeling. That's how I fell in love with her. She allowed me to be the leader and I love her for that because it made me take ownership of our relationship with God.\"\n\n\"Her eyes, her smile, her love of the rosary, her love of family, and her appreciation of living a simple life.\n\n\"She is tough and never complains. So when I see her and how tiny she is trying to lift heavy things or take on big tasks, I think that is very attractive, \"sexy\" if you will.\"\n\n\"Physical attraction was first when we started dating. I also wanted to date someone who from a good family. Then I grew to love her more by the way she was caring for others, her faith was strong, and she had a heart of gold. She was the perfect fit for me and I knew it. I loved her family and she loved my family. Then she passed the \"Doe test.\" That is all I needed!

    "content": "_God is moving..._\n\nThis has been my prayer for life lately because life lately has me feeling like I am going no where; a stagnant season. This season has come and gone before, but it is always accompanied by many fears. Fear that I am the only one who is not moving forward in life. Fear that God has forgotten me. Fear that I will always be in this \"in between\" state. Fear that I am running around aimlessly with no direction. Fear that if I don't take control and make something happen, that nothing ever will.\n\nI am going to take a wild guess and say that you have also experienced a time in your life when you felt as though the Lord was not moving...\n\nIt's hard to admit that (even type it out!) because I know it is just not true. But I have felt that way and maybe you have as well.\n\nSomething that shook me from this false reality was a talk I heard a week ago. The talk was about how we tend to expect God to move and act as we would. We expect Him to do things the way we expect them to be done and in our time frame. And if things are not happening the way we expect them to happen, then we think God is not moving.\n\nOuch.\n\nHow often do we assume that nothing is happening in our lives if life is not happening the way we want it or in the time frame we want it? I am guilty of this. I am guilty of limiting God to my own perception. Maybe you are still single and you are waiting for your spouse, maybe you are married and have been trying to concieve for years, maybe you do not have the job you really want. Life doesn't seem to be going your way, prayers don't seem to be answered.\n\nBut the reality is this: **God is always moving because He so loves us. He wants to be in every single detail of our lives because He cares that much. **His ways are a mystery and as cliche as that sounds (and not very comforting at times) it is the truth. We can't begin to comprehend what God is doing in us and around us. He sees eternity. We see fragments of life. Just like a flower first forms and grows underground, many times we can not see what the Lord is doing or what He is preparing, but eventually a flower blooms up from the secrecy of the earth and beauty is born.\n\nWe have a Father who loves us far too much to just let us be. He is moving in His most perfect and mysterious way. I will continue to speak this out, even sing it out, to battle the lie that our lives are not that important because He has shown us otherwise.\n\nSo, for now, I will pray for a deeper surrender, a deeper freedom to allow myself to be surprised because...\n\n_God is moving._\n\n_\"Blessed are those who have not seen yet have believed.\" John 20:29_\n\nBe His,",

Hopefully this list helps or at least gives you food for thought.\n\n**1. If he/she is not a man/woman of their word.**\n\nIf the person you are dating continues to say one thing and do another, this is a red flag! There will be times when he or she cannot follow through but if this is a continual habit then it's time to say goodbye!\n\n**2. If you are not physically attracted to the person.**\n\nThis may seem obvious or even shallow, but attraction is the first thing you have between you and the other person. Yes, attraction grows, but do not force yourself to be with someone you are not attracted to just because they are a \"nice person\" or you because you just want to be in a relationship right now.\n\n**3. If you don't connect on a deeper level with them.**\n\nYou want to be with someone you can have good conversation with. Can you share your deeper thoughts? Can he or she \"go there\" with you? Conversation is a way you get to know the other person's heart.\n\n**4. If you can't be yourself.**\n\nIf you can't be your truest self around this person, that is a major red flag. You want to be with someone who brings out the best in you. If you don't like who you are when you are around this person, that is a major red flag!\n\n**5. If he/she doesn't make time for you.**\n\nSimple. If they are not willing to make time or invite you into their life, then you don't need to waste your time.\n\n**6. If he/she does not help you to be the best verson of yourself.**\n\nThis is very similar to #4. If the person does not encourage you to be the best version of yourself then you do not want to prolong the relationship. You want someone who is going to make you better.\n\n**7. If he/she only texts and rarely calls.**\n\nTexting has become such a habit for our culture. Texting has it's bonuses, BUT it is not a place to have deep conversation or to talk about things that should be shared person to person, face to face. It is easy to hide behind texts, but that is not what you want.\n\n**8.  If he/she does not have good friends of the same sex.**\n\nIt is important for guys and girls to have good friends of the same sex. There is a way that girls understand girls and guys understand guys. We need each other. Also, if the guy or girl doesn't have any friends at all...might be something you want to look into.\n\n**9. If he/she doesn't show a desire to get married and or have kids.**\n\nIf you are ready to get married, don't date around with guys/girls who are not wanting to marry or want to wait years before they do. You don't want waste your time and get hurt in the end if you are not on the same page.\n\n**10. If he/she is not willing to uphold their purity as well as your's.**\n\nIf you are trying to live a life of chastity, you want to be with someone who is also striving for that as well. Bottom line, be with someone who wants to protect you just as much as you want to protect them.\n\nAgain, these are things that have been red flags for us. You might have some different ones, but we hope these help!\n\n-\n\nBe His,",

    "content": "I first want to preface this blog with the fact that this is not a blog bashing men. Our Makeupless Monday video was not a video to lash out on men for being creepy, unsafe, or not worthy of a second date. Our video and this blog are merely tools to help women ( like ourselves) to be honest by not leading men on when we are not interested or tips for women in the unfortunate case when their saftey is compromised.\n\nI will say, I have been on dates when I knew I was not interested in more, but I have never been on a date when I have felt my safety was in question or a date that I was not treated like a lady. Thanks be to God!\n\n**_If you know you are not interested in another date...._**\n\nLadies, just be honest. For me, I would worry (sometimes still do!) of hurting the guy's feelings and then I would find myself agreeing to a second date or just being extremely vague of whether I was interested in a second date or not.

Maybe some of you don't mind it as much and maybe some of you even thrive off conflict. I am not one of those people! It is something I have had to slowly learn to not be afraid of because sometimes beautiful things can come from conflict.\n\nThis has been surprising, but I have found that my faith has been a source of conflict for some people. Most of the times, it comes up at the airport. The airport seems to be a hot spot for all kinds of conversations! I am building up a collection of good stories to share later! But for now, here is one...\n\nI was flying home from New York where I was visiting my brother and his family. I sat down in my seat and there was an older gentleman sitting at the window seat. As I normally do (because the reality of flying kind of scares me) I pulled out my rosary beads. The older gentlemen next to me looked over to see my rosary. He remarked with a gruntled voice, \"Oh, you must be catholic.\" I didn't even have to look at the man to know his eyes were rolling. My heart started racing immediately. I went into panic mode within 3 seconds flat. I had this overwhelming thought of, \"I need to be able to counter attack all of his misconceptions and prove to him that I am not crazy because I am catholic!\" So, I turned to face the man, took a deep breath, and before I could get a word out he said, \"You've got it wrong.\"\n\nFor the next 30 minutes or so, I sat there listening to this man go through scientific theory after scientific theory trying to disprove God and the Catholic Church. At first, I was trying really hard to concentrate on all he was saying so I could combat each statement. Then, it hit me. I have the Holy Spirit and He knows everything! I literally prayed in my heart, \"Come Holy Spirit, give me the words to say!\" Instantly, I was calmed. Then it was clear, I just needed to listen to this man and the Holy Spirit will lead the way. As I listened, my own heart softened. This man had been through a lot of suffering in his life and he just couldn't see that if there was a God, that He was actually good.\n\nAt one point, we were on the topic of purpose. I had told him that as Christians we believe God created everything with purpose. He laughed and sat in silence for a minute. I could just tell he was about to throw something at me (not literally, but figuratively). As he was laughing he said, \"Ok, you Christians think everything has purpose. So, go ahead and tell me the purpose of broccoli.\" In that split moment, I was relieved it wasn't some abstract concept, but then I began to panic because it was so unexpected! As I sat there, (fully relying on the Holy Spirit to get me out of this one), it came to me. I looked at the man and said, \"Of course broccoli has purpose...to eat it!\" The man immediately went into laughter and I followed suit. He admitted, \"You got me there!\"\n\nAfter our flight landed, he had told me that he was a science professor at a well-known college. I realized that I knew a science professor there as well who happend to be a devout christian and practicing catholic. I encouraged the man to reach out to my friend. A day to two later, I found out that the man I knew had just started a series in the science department about being a scientist AND a Christian!\n\nI don't know what happend to this man, but this experience taught me something...conflict is not bad. We should not be afraid of it either. There is beauty in vulnerability. We need to allow space for people to be vulnerable and be vulnerable in return. We need to invite the Holy Spirit into our conflicts, He wants to be there and He is a game changer. When we invite Him in, He begins to transform our own hearts.\n\nI hope and pray this man realizes there is still good in the world...because God is good and God is still here.\n\n-\n\nBe His,",

    "content": "It is quite the challenge to sum up the camino in a blog. When people ask, \"How was the camino?\" I don't even know where to begin! The camino was many things: trying, telling, exhausting, humbling, beautiful, thrilling, painful, moving. But, there is one thing the camino was not--it was not comfortable.\n\nI, like many others I am sure, enjoy staying in my comfort zone. I like routine, I like knowing the culture, the people, the language. I like the safety of having control of some things in my life. I like being comfortable.\n\nI quickly learned on the Camino that I would be kissing comfort goobye! I was in a foreign country, I did not know or understand the language well, there was no air condition, my feet hurt every single day, and I was to get up at 5:30am and walk every day for a month, I was to walk across a country by looking for yellow arrows and shell signs. Why did I think this was a good idea?\n\nOh, but it was.\n\nIn the beginning, I would frantically search for the yellow arrows to point me in the right direction. I was so afraid of getting lost! But guess what happened...my sister and I got lost! I led us up a mountain we weren't supposed to be hiking. A nice man driving up the mountain saw our backpacks and through the grace of God, we were able to understand his spanish enough to know we were heading in the wrong direction. That was the last thing my sister and I wanted to hear after climbing this mountain for about 30-45 minutes--but it was something I needed.\n\nOne of the greatest lessons I learned was not to be afraid of not knowing. Every time I found myself getting anxious because I wasn't sure if I was heading in the right direction, I learned to just pray, \"Jesus, if we are walking in the wrong direction, You will let us know.\" He let us know every single time. A yellow arrow would appear, I would see another pilgrim in the distance, or sometimes people in the town would help us. They were always looking out for pilgrims and sometimes would literally take you by the hand and walk you across the street to make sure you were on the right side of the road! My sister and I were always taken care of.\n\n_The fear of not knowing is very real but very unnecessary._\n\nMost of my Camino was spent not knowing anything. I did not know how the weather would be, I did not know how my feet were going to respond, I did not know how far we would walk, I did not know about the people I would encounter, I did not know how I would communicate with people, I did not know where I was going to stay, I did not know a lot of things. And it became a freedom I did not know I would enjoy so greatly.\n\nSomething happened in my soul while I was on the Camino. I did not know it until I had returned home--somewhere in the midst of not knowing, my heart became open. I feel more free and ready for what God has in-store for me! I am trusting more in a God who takes care of all the details.\n\nI am happy and free to not know.\n\nI pray the next time fear starts to sneak it's way into my life, I can remember the Camino and remember the freedom of letting go and the freedom in being uncomfortable.\n\n_\"The world offers you comfort, but you were not made for comfort. You were made for greatness.\"- Pope Benedict XVI_\n\nBe His,",
