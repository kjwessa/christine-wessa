_God is moving..._

This has been my prayer for life lately because life lately has me feeling like I am going no where; a stagnant season. This season has come and gone before, but it is always accompanied by many fears. Fear that I am the only one who is not moving forward in life. Fear that God has forgotten me. Fear that I will always be in this "in between" state. Fear that I am running around aimlessly with no direction. Fear that if I don't take control and make something happen, that nothing ever will.

I am going to take a wild guess and say that you have also experienced a time in your life when you felt as though the Lord was not moving...

It's hard to admit that (even type it out!) because I know it is just not true. But I have felt that way and maybe you have as well.

Something that shook me from this false reality was a talk I heard a week ago. The talk was about how we tend to expect God to move and act as we would. We expect Him to do things the way we expect them to be done and in our time frame. And if things are not happening the way we expect them to happen, then we think God is not moving.

Ouch.

How often do we assume that nothing is happening in our lives if life is not happening the way we want it or in the time frame we want it? I am guilty of this. I am guilty of limiting God to my own perception. Maybe you are still single and you are waiting for your spouse, maybe you are married and have been trying to concieve for years, maybe you do not have the job you really want. Life doesn't seem to be going your way, prayers don't seem to be answered.

But the reality is this: **God is always moving because He so loves us. He wants to be in every single detail of our lives because He cares that much. **His ways are a mystery and as cliche as that sounds (and not very comforting at times) it is the truth. We can't begin to comprehend what God is doing in us and around us. He sees eternity. We see fragments of life. Just like a flower first forms and grows underground, many times we can not see what the Lord is doing or what He is preparing, but eventually a flower blooms up from the secrecy of the earth and beauty is born.

We have a Father who loves us far too much to just let us be. He is moving in His most perfect and mysterious way. I will continue to speak this out, even sing it out, to battle the lie that our lives are not that important because He has shown us otherwise.

So, for now, I will pray for a deeper surrender, a deeper freedom to allow myself to be surprised because...

_God is moving._
