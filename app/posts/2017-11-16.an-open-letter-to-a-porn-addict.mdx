Dear Brother or Sister,

I want to tell you that you are loved. I want to tell you that your addiction to pornography does not define who you are. You are so much more than that, and so is the person on the other side of that screen.

I want to tell you that *you are worth the fight*.

I want to apologize for how easily accessible pornography is. I am so sorry our world has made it seemingly effortless to become addicted to it. I am so sorry for the ways pornography has affected the people around you. I am sorry for the darkness and shame you feel you have to remain hidden in because of your addiction. Shame creates a prison, and you don't have to live there anymore.

_You are worth the fight._

I may not know the daily struggle with pornography, but I know the daily struggle to live in the light. I know the struggle to live in hope and not despair. I know the struggle to live in freedom from things of the world. I know the feeling of being exhausted from the fight. But please, don't quit.

_You are worth the fight._

Do not believe the lie that there is nothing wrong with pornography. Do not believe the lie that you cannot break free. Do not believe the lie that you are ruined. Please, do not give up. *You are worth the fight* and so are those men and women who are in the pornography industry. Many are winning this battle, and you can too.

It is ultimately your choice, but know that I am fighting for you. I will never stop praying for you to be free.

You are loved and you are worth the fight. And you can win.

"I can do all things in Christ who strengthens me."- Philippians 4:13

Be His,
