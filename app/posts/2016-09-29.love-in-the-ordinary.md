**LOVE**. This four letter word is the core of our very existence. We were made for love, by love, to love. Then why in the world is it such a difficult thing?

In light of all the recent news of the shootings and riots I find myself (like many others) wondering what can be done? I have day-dreamed many times about being in the midst of these riots and finding a platform to stand on high above the crowds and singing something like “Amazing Grace” or “How Great Thou Art” and magically the crowds begin to hush. People stop shouting to listen, weapons are put down, then voices are raised in song, people join hands and everyone forgets what they were angered about because their thoughts are turned towards Love. Their hearts remember Love.

(I know...a very dramatic and hollywood-ish day dream, but a girl can dream, right?)

We’ve all seen this in the movies…for example, in the movie Elf! People are doubting the real existence of Santa Claus and thus there is no Christmas spirit to keep Santa and his reindeer soaring through the night—which means there will be no Christmas at all. All of a sudden Jovie the elf stands before the crowd and begins to sing a Christmas carol. Then people start to chime in and before you know it the whole crowd is singing and the joy and magic of Christmas is restored in their hearts and Santa and his sleigh are back in business! As silly as this example might be it makes me think about how our hearts have forgotten the power of *Love*. As we grow up we see more of the imperfection, more of the darkness in this world; our hearts become cold.

_This is what we have forgotten. We have forgotten the power of Love._

St. Therese of Lisieux is a saint known for doing ordinary activities with great love. Just like St. Therese, I also feel small and unsure of how I can do anything great. But it was in her doing small things with great love for Love Himself that she became a saint! In her “little way” she saw opportunities in the ordinary to love God. No matter how small or ordinary it may be…everything became an opportunity to love Him. And she wanted to love Him because she knew that she was loved.

Imagine if we started to see the ordinary and mundane things as opportunities to love—to love the One who has always loved us.

Doing the dishes for Love. Getting up multiple times in the middle of the night with your child for Love. Waking up at 5:45 am to get ready for work everyday for Love. Folding laundry for Love. Doing homework for Love. Cooking meal after meal for your family for Love. Waiting for Love.

Many times I find myself waiting for that “big way” to show God I love Him…when in fact, He is seeking me in the little ordinary ways.

Love has the power to make the ordinary extraordinary. Don’t give up on the power of Love--because “love never fails.”(1 corinthians 13:8)

_Find Love in the ordinary today._

“My vocation, at last I have found it; my vocation is Love.” - St. Therese of Lisieux

Be His,
