“This is perhaps the greatest risk any of us will take, to be seen as we truly are.” –Fairy Godmother from Cinderella.

Thank you, Fairy Godmother, for calling out one of our culture’s greatest struggles! Who would’ve thought this sweet movie would dive deep into the depths of every human battle. The battle of vulnerability.

“To be seen as we truly are.” To be honest, this line makes me squirm. I don’t want someone to see me for who I truly am—no way, Jose! I am a sinner. I am imperfect. I make mistakes. It is way easier to cover all of this and mask it. Hide my imperfection—because if I allow people to see me for who I truly am then…

I will not be lovable.

I will not be desired.

I will not be wanted.

Lies. All of these are lies.

I have believed all these lies. Sometimes I catch myself falling for them still. Sometimes I am scared to go out in public without makeup on because I fear I am not beautiful enough and men won’t find me attractive or desirable. Sometimes I hide my true feelings because I fear rejection. I find that I fear most that I will not be loved or accepted because of my imperfection. The struggle to allow myself to be seen for exactly who I am, the good and the bad, is a daily battle. But I dare say I am not the only one who struggles with being scared to allow people to see you.

But when I look at people around me that I admire and love I have discovered something else: I love the imperfection I see. I love the vulnerability. I love the brokenness. I love the weakness. I love the mess.

I love it because I see me.

But why is it that I love the humanness I see in others but am so afraid for others to see the humanness in me? I think this is one of the devil’s greatest tricks—to make us feel alone; to separate us from each other because we were created for each other.

I pray for the strength to let myself be seen for who I really am. I pray we can all come to know the beauty in our brokenness—a beauty that even Jesus Himself cannot resist.

Let yourself be seen. Because it is beautiful.
