Earlier this week for Makeup-less Monday, we filmed a video with 10 "red flags" that we have seen in dating and we wanted to share them again with you!

Sometimes it is easy to overlook these red flags in the beginning or sometimes we don't even know what qualifies as a "red flag." Together Maria, Kara, and I put together a list of 10 Red Flags to be aware of when dating! Hopefully this list helps or at least gives you food for thought.

**1. If he/she is not a man/woman of their word.**

If the person you are dating continues to say one thing and do another, this is a red flag! There will be times when he or she cannot follow through but if this is a continual habit then it's time to say goodbye!

**2. If you are not physically attracted to the person.**

This may seem obvious or even shallow, but attraction is the first thing you have between you and the other person. Yes, attraction grows, but do not force yourself to be with someone you are not attracted to just because they are a "nice person" or you because you just want to be in a relationship right now.

**3. If you don't connect on a deeper level with them.**

You want to be with someone you can have good conversation with. Can you share your deeper thoughts? Can he or she "go there" with you? Conversation is a way you get to know the other person's heart.

**4. If you can't be yourself.**

If you can't be your truest self around this person, that is a major red flag. You want to be with someone who brings out the best in you. If you don't like who you are when you are around this person, that is a major red flag!

**5. If he/she doesn't make time for you.**

Simple. If they are not willing to make time or invite you into their life, then you don't need to waste your time.

**6. If he/she does not help you to be the best verson of yourself.**

This is very similar to #4. If the person does not encourage you to be the best version of yourself then you do not want to prolong the relationship. You want someone who is going to make you better.

**7. If he/she only texts and rarely calls.**

Texting has become such a habit for our culture. Texting has it's bonuses, BUT it is not a place to have deep conversation or to talk about things that should be shared person to person, face to face. It is easy to hide behind texts, but that is not what you want.

**8.  If he/she does not have good friends of the same sex.**

It is important for guys and girls to have good friends of the same sex. There is a way that girls understand girls and guys understand guys. We need each other. Also, if the guy or girl doesn't have any friends at all...might be something you want to look into.

**9. If he/she doesn't show a desire to get married and or have kids.**

If you are ready to get married, don't date around with guys/girls who are not wanting to marry or want to wait years before they do. You don't want waste your time and get hurt in the end if you are not on the same page.

**10. If he/she is not willing to uphold their purity as well as your's.**

If you are trying to live a life of chastity, you want to be with someone who is also striving for that as well. Bottom line, be with someone who wants to protect you just as much as you want to protect them.

Again, these are things that have been red flags for us. You might have some different ones, but we hope these help!
