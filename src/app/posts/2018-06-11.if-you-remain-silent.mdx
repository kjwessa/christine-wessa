**“**For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?”- Esther 4:14

_If you remain silent…_

I remember when Maria, Kara and I were first talking about this ministry. I remember thinking that I did not have anything worthwhile to share and I did not have what it took to be “in ministry.” I would rather stay off the radar of what I thought was ministry and continue to live an ordinary and insignificant life (at least that is how I saw it then).

Being silent about things can easily be my default. I have never been one for confrontation. I am not one who likes to engage in debates. I have never been one who likes to stir the pot. Quite the opposite actually! Heck, I used to be afraid to make the sign of the cross in public for fear of making someone uncomfortable.

_But something changed._

I came to realize my love for Jesus was much stronger than my desire to be comfortable. I was invited into this side of ministry not because I have what it takes but because Jesus IS what it takes. I could no longer stand back and watch my self, my sisters, friends, and any other girl fall into the traps of the culture. I could see myself falling into this lie that this life was all there was.

- the lie that being different from a man was a weakness.
- the lie that I had to earn my worth.
- the lie that I was not enough to be loved as I was.
- the lie that I don’t need anyone.
- the lie that being skinny and tan would make me beautiful.
- the lie that truth is relative.
- the lie that I was not important.

If I remain silent, someone else will probably speak up, but I am responsible for NOW. I have a duty, just like you, to live truth and to speak truth, especially when it is being attacked.

Ladies, perhaps you and I were born for such a time as this. Time to be courageous, time to be kind, time to be compassionate, time to be defenders of life, to speak truth, time to remind woman that being a woman is a gift and all that comes with it, time to rise up! Let’s do this!

Be His,
